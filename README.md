# Learning_Create_Repo
I am learning to create a repo: My first one! Excited.,..!!!
MIssed to include this the first time. So created another Learning_Create_Repo when I got the message along the lines of
"Already Used... get another name...". So then I thought, let me see if I can add a Readme if I missed to include it the
first time... So this is my attempt at it... Now what...??? Looking to save this file... Will try commit new file button 
at the bottom of this page...
